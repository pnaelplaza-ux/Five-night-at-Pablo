## Packages
(none needed - base stack is sufficient for this game)

## Notes
- Audio files and images are imported directly from @assets alias as requested.
- The game uses a custom hook/context for the game loop (interval-based state updates).
- CSS includes custom CRT overlays and static animations to achieve the horror aesthetic.
